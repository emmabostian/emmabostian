Hey y'all, I'm Emma! I'm a Software Engineer at Spotify in Stockholm, Sweden. Born and raised in Red Hook, New York I moved down to Austin, Texas after college to join IBM as a Software Engineer. I worked on Quantum Computing, Linux on Power Developer Portal, IBM Support, and Spectrum Control for three years before uprooting my two kitties and moving to Germany. I worked in Karlsruhe, Germany on GoToMeeting for two and a half years before I moved to Stockholm this July to begin my dream job at Spotify!

In my spare time I create courses for [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-systems/) and [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/writing-a-tech-resume/). I podcast for the [Ladybug Podcast](http://ladybug.dev/) and [JSParty](https://changelog.com/jsparty).
